       <!-- you are appending children to card-suits which has a class
    so everything in it is gonna have those styles

just create another html element and specifically put the cards in there
like you did above*-->
<!-- Cant i just create the ul in js and the li within it or no
but you didnt do that?  you just created li and added them to h3
which doesnt make sense, you would have to create a ul
add li to it
and then add the ul after the h3
ye ur right but im just a little confused on how to add elements to the parent 
the problem is your html
you dont have a good structure, you trynna raw dog it
you need a structure that is seperate and each element
has its own purpose
h3 is a heading, it just has a text in it
no children.

for all the cards, like you did above
create an empty ul, seperate from the title, and add to it
-->
       <h3 class="gold-color" >My Hand</h3>
       <ul id="my-hand"></ul>
